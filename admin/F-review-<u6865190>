Yuqing Zhai(u6865190) review the task 3 code from Yufan Zhou. 

1. What are the best features of this code?

This code uses basic if and for loop, so there is no repeating code. And the loop is well-formed so there is no double check, which saves running time.

2. Is the code well-documented?

Yes, this code is well-document.

3. Is the program decomposition (class and method structure) appropriate?

Yes, this code use previous methods like isTilePlacementWellFormed() appropriate to save running time.

4. Does it follow Java code conventions (for example, are methods and variables properly named), and is the style consistent throughout?

Yes, this code follows the Java code conventions and the sytle consistent through out, so it is easy to read. 

5. If you suspect an error in the code, suggest a particular situation in which the program will not function correctly.

I think there is no error in this code. The only thing I think can improve is that the last if statement can be simpler.
We can use only one line to return a boolean, like below:
return !(count>=3);
